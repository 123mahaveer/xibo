## Contributing
We'd love to work with you and accept your contributions. For small changes like bug fixes, typos, etc. Please Fork us and submit a pull request with the details of what you have changed.

For larger changes, you will have to electronically sign a statement that indicates two things:

* You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of the open source license of the project that you're contributing to.

* You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

This is called a Contributor Licence Agreement or "CLA" for short.

The standard licence for Xibo is the [AGPLv3](LICENSE). For more information please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Branching Model
Xibo uses the [Gitflow Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), we would therefore like to encourage any contributors to read and understand that model so you know where to branch from / submit a pull request to.

We do have a slight adjustment to the model to support bug fixes into past releases, in that our release/x.x.x branches will only be removed when a subsequent release in that series is made. This branch should be used for hot fixes into that release.

# History
Xibo has been under development since 2008 and has had many successful releases. Prior to 1.7.0 our project was hosted on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/xibo/).
